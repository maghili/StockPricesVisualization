# StockPricesVisualization

This project is done as the Milestone project for 12 day program of The Data Incubator for implementing **Flask**, **Bokeh**, and **Heroku App**. The code presented here acquires some data from the user, for example the date range, the type of prices they want etc. and they will get an interactive graph of the prices requested in that time range.

The working version of this app in Heroku exists <a href="https://stockpricesvisualization.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
